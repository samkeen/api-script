# for any interaction (PUT|PATCH|DELETE) with a Resource, there must
#   first be a Resource, these are the properties to use to create those
#   sacrificial Resources
#
# ex: For a Get tests, the test framework:
#   - first creates a Resource (POST)
#   - then runs the Get under test
#   - finally the test framework issues a Delete request for cleanup
resource_seeds:
  /product:
    name: php::uniqid()

tests:
    # test names need to be in the format:
    # '{http method} ... {path}'
    #
    # start/end slashes are optional for {path}
    # i.e 'product', '/product' and '/product' are all parsed as: '/product
    #'
